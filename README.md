## NNP
This package implements a neural-network potential (NNP) based on the Behler-Parrinello architecture (*Phys. Rev. Lett.* **98** (2007) 146401) within C++ code. The Chebyshev polynomials proposed by Artrith et al. (*Phys. Rev. B* **96** (2017) 014112) are used as descriptors.

## Requirement
MPI libraries are required to compile the source code and run the executable.

## Installation
Within the `src` directory, edit the Makefile and execute `make`.

## License
This package is distributed under the [GNU public license](https://github.com/NU-programs/NNP/blob/main/LICENSE).
